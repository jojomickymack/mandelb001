## Mandelbrot with go/sdl

This is by no means an optimized or high quality fractal rendering app - rather it's a proof of concept of copying go image rbga data over into an sdl 
texture and presenting it.

controls:
left, right, up, down - move the focus
enter - zoom in

todo: employ some techniques for increasing the rendering speed.
